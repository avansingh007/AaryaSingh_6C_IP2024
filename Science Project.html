<p align = "left">
This navigation satellite system was developed because access to foreign government-controlled global navigation satellite systems is not guaranteed in hostile situations, as happened to the Indian military in 1999 when the United States denied an Indian request for Global Positioning System (GPS) data for the Kargil region, which would have provided vital information.The Indian government approved the project in May 2006.Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), with an operational name of NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation), is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system that provides accurate real-time positioning and timing services.It covers India and a region extending 1,500 km (930 mi) around it, with plans for further extension up to 3,000 km (1,900 mi).
<br></br>

<b><u> # System Overview:</u> </b>
<br></br>
<b>1.Constellation:</b>
NAVIC consists of 8 satellites, with 7 active and 1 standby.
<br></br>
<b>2.Orbit:</b>
