Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most brilliant and influential mathematicians 
of the 20th century. He made groundbreaking contributions to various areas of mathematics, Often regarded as one of the greatest
mathematicians of all time, though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to 
mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems
then considered unsolvable.

<br></br>
<b><i>Early Life:</i></b>
<br></br>
  Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 into a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family in Tamil Nadu.His father was Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar
worked as a clerk in Sari shop and his mother, Komalatammal, was a housewife and sang at a local temple.
<br></br>
  Since Ramanujan's father was at work most of the day, his mother took care of the boy, and they had a close relationship. From her,
he learned about tradition and puranas, to sing religious songs, to attend pujas at the temple, and to maintain particular eating habits—all
part of Brahmin culture.In his Primary Schooling, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his
primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography, and arithmetic with the best scores in the district.
That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.
<br></br>
  A child with extreme talent by age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students who were lodgers at his home.
He was later lent a book written by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry and mastered in it while his age was just 13.
<br></br>
  When he was 15 years old, he obtained a copy of George Shoobridge Carr’s "A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics"
2 vol.(1880–86), This was collection of 5000 theorems, many presented with only the briefest of proofs and with no material newer
than 1860, aroused his genius. Having verified the results in Carr’s book, Ramanujan went beyond it, developing his own theorems and ideas.
When he graduated from Town Higher Secondary School in 1904, Ramanujan was awarded the K. Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics by
the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer. Iyer introduced Ramanujan as an outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum
In 1903 he secured a scholarship to the University of Madras but lost it the following year because he neglected all other studies in pursuit of
mathematics.
<br></br>
  Ramanujan continued his work, without employment and living in the poorest circumstances. After marrying in 1909 he began a search
for permanent employment that culminated in an interview with a government official, Ramachandra Rao. Impressed by Ramanujan’s mathematical
prowess, Rao supported his research for a time, but Ramanujan, unwilling to exist on charity, obtained a clerical post with the
Madras Port Trust.
<br></br>
<b><i>Journey in persuit of his career in Mathmatics:</i></b>
<br></br>
  In 1910, after a meeting between the 23-year-old Ramanujan and the founder of the Indian Mathematical Society, V. Ramaswamy Aiyer,
Ramanujan began to get recognition in Madras's mathematical circles, leading to his inclusion as a researcher at the University of Madras.
<br></br>
  Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society where he formulated an equation that could be used to solve the infinitely 
<i>nested radicals problem</i>. His first formal paper for the Journal on the properties of <i>Bernoulli numbers</i>.

<br></br>
His collaboration with G. H. Hardy was instrumental in gaining recognition within the mathematical community. Despite differences
in their backgrounds, they produced significant mathematical results together. Ramanujan's profound knowledge spanned continued fractions,
the Riemann series, elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his innovative theory of divergent series called Ramanujan summation.
Despite being unfamiliar with modern mathematical developments, he made substantial contributions.
<br></br>

His expertise in the partition of numbers—expressing a positive integer as the sum of positive integers—furthered his acclaim.
Ramanujan's papers were published in English and European journals, leading to his election to the Royal Society of London in 1918.
<br></br>
In 1917, Ramanujan contracted tuberculosis, prompting his return to India in 1919. Despite ongoing health struggles, 
he continued working on mathematical problems until his untimely death in 1920 at the age of 32. He left behind three notebooks
and a "lost notebook" containing unpublished results that continue to captivate mathematicians.
<br></br>
Srinivasa Ramanujan's life story, marked by resilience and dedication to mathematics, has inspired numerous books, documentaries,
and movies. His extraordinary journey from a self-taught mathematician in India to an internationally recognized genius underscores
his enduring legacy in the world of mathematics.
